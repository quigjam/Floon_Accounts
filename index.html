            </div>
            <div id="collapseOne" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-parent="#accordionExample">
                <div class="card-body"> <span style="font-size: 24px;">
                    <p>
                        “No. I don’t think I will.” 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The General chuckled. “You didn’t  even let me ask the question this time.”</p>
                    <p> 
                        I didn’t need need to know because it was always the same thing. The General wanted me to do something. “Last time I let you finish one of your fiendish questions, I ended up defacto Captain.” 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That was only half true. The personality of the current Captain made her unfit to handle certain logistical tasks. Tasks that naturally fell to on the Vice-Captain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The General was standing behind the simple table that served as his desk. His eyes focused on inspecting a collection of paint bottles. “It’s only for two months. After that, Ashley will be back from her assignment.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “The assignment you can't speak about.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He smiled again. “Correct.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would have groaned if not for retaining proper manners and denying any satisfaction it might give him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As always, the General had an unnatural melancholy about him which I could never understand. It was midwinter and quite cold. Half the camp walked around wearing their coats at all hours. They other half were soldiers who didn’t own coats and they still walked around with cot blankets over their shoulders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The General finally met my gaze. Pogchamp, he was finally shifting his attention to the conversation. “We need someone to keep an account of things. Write stuff down for the sake of history. There’s no telling what will happen within the next year or even the next few months. Frankly, it could all be over by then. Us all wrapped in chains or walking to the gallows.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He didn’t smile. It was obvious to anyone who knew the General that he thought a great deal about how this “revolution” would end up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Floon you’re the best suited for the job. Your educated, raised from common stock, and have a sharp perspective.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He was right on at least two of those accounts but I was sure as the Nine Hells not going to let him know it. “My education is comprised entirely of the ability to read, write, and a smattering of agricultural knowledge. Surely Sara or …” 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was interrupted by the sound of someone entering the tent behind me. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I already have enough occupying my schedule already” chimed Sara walking in carrying a travel bag and a large stack of books “cleaning up after certain children chronically allergic to their proper duties.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She was of course referring to the General who provided similar problems for her as Ashley did for me. He only smirked like he'd been caught with his had in a cookie jar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “He is right though.” she began, placing the books on the table. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Creator save us, if these two were agreeing then we really must be doomed. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “And with the ongoing sickness within the camp Sister Esther is occupied.”  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I frowned in disgust. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A nasty illness had begun within the camp, spawning greenish-brown boils on the soles of the feet and causing a large number of lunches to be expelled the way they had entered. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In time, vomit would turn from green to red as the stomach lining began to rupture. I had some medical training but found myself quite overwhelmed by the whole endeavor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “No need to worry. We’ve called for a professional.” stated the General.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My attention snapped back to the conversation. His attention had returned to his paints which he was neatly placing into his own travel bag. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “And where will the two of you be during this time?” I asked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “On an assignment.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “An assignment you can’t speak about”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The General smiled. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Correct.”
                    </p>
                    </span>
